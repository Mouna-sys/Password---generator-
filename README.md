Assumptions:
Input Validation: The code assumes the user will enter valid integer input for the password length.
It assumes the user will enter valid boolean input for the include options.
No input validation is performed to check for negative password lengths.
Character Sets:
The character sets for alphabets, numbers, and symbols are predefined. You can modify these strings to include or exclude specific characters.
The alphabets are upper and lower case.
Randomness: SecureRandom is used for generating cryptographically strong random numbers.
No GUI: This is a console based application. A GUI would be required for a real app.
Error Handling: No error handling is implemented. If the user enters invalid input, the program may crash.
No hosting: Hosting a java console application on a temp site is not possible. Java console applications are not designed to run in a web browser. Java web applications are required for online hosting.

public class Stage1PasswordGenerator {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter password length: ");
        int length = scanner.nextInt();
        String password = generatePassword(length);
        System.out.println("Generated password: " + password);
        scanner.close();
    }

    public static String generatePassword(int length) {
        String alphabets = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
        SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
        StringBuilder password = new StringBuilder();

        for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            int randomIndex = random.nextInt(alphabets.length());
            password.append(alphabets.charAt(randomIndex));
        }
        return password.toString();
    }
}

Explanation:
Input:The program prompts the user to enter the desired password length.
Character Set: A string alphabets is defined containing all uppercase and lowercase letters.
Random Generation:SecureRandom is used to generate random numbers. A loop iterates length times.
In each iteration, a random index is generated within the range of the alphabets string.
The character at the random index is appended to the password StringBuilder.
Output:The generated password is printed to the console.
